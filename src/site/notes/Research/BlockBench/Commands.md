To smoothly scale, move, and rotate, you need to hold a **modifier key**. You can't do it on a tablet or a phone device (without a keyboard).
- On tablet or a phone, without a keyboard, you'll have to change all of these settings
 
#### Alt
![alt.gif|left wsmall](/img/user/Research/BlockBench/IMG/alt.gif)To scale a cube on both sides along an axis at once.








![alt-(mesh).gif|left wsmall](/img/user/Research/BlockBench/IMG/alt-(mesh).gif) If you work in a mesh, however, it works the opposite way. By default, a mesh model scales dynamically on both sides at the same time, and holding alt changes it so it's only one you're pulling towards. This means you can pull from different directions, as shown.





#### Shift
![shift-move.gif|left wsmall](/img/user/Research/BlockBench/IMG/shift-move.gif)When held, it moves at increments of 0.25. That's a fourth of a square on the default 16x6 grid we work on in Blockbench.







![shift-rotating.gif|left wsmall](/img/user/Research/BlockBench/IMG/shift-rotating.gif)Holding shift when rotating, you rotate at 22.5° per increment. Basically, a fourth of quarter per step. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
![shift-rotating-default.gif|left wsmall](/img/user/Research/BlockBench/IMG/shift-rotating-default.gif)By default, when you rotate, objects are moving at 1.5 degrees per increment. 








#### Ctrl
![ctrl-move.gif|left wsmall](/img/user/Research/BlockBench/IMG/ctrl-move.gif)![ctrl-scale.gif|left wsmall](/img/user/Research/BlockBench/IMG/ctrl-scale.gif)This allow us, similar to the shift key, instead to scale and move by 0.1. That's a tenth of a square on the default 16x6 grid here in BlockBench





![ctrl-rotate.gif|left wsmall](/img/user/Research/BlockBench/IMG/ctrl-rotate.gif)Whilst holding control, you rotate it 1° degree per increment.









#### Ctrl + Shift
![ctrlshift.gif|left wsmall](/img/user/Research/BlockBench/IMG/ctrlshift.gif)When you hit them at the same time and you move or scale, it scales and moves at an increment of a fourth of a tenth of the 16x6 grid here in BlockBench. Basically, a 40th of one of the squares of the grid





![ctrlshift-rotate.gif|left wsmall](/img/user/Research/BlockBench/IMG/ctrlshift-rotate.gif) When rotating, it's 0.25 of a degree in increments, although it's a bit hard to see.










## Tips

- In the viewport you can see the affected values where the cursor is as you're clicking and dragging, or you can see them on the panel on the right side. The ==blue outline== you see when you rotate or move is a ==**reference point**== to where the cube was located before.
