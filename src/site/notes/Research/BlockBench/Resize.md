Normally, you would avoid to be using this, but if you are looking to make **inverted cubes** this is the way to do it. So ArtsByKev normally recommends to have this setting active.

*Important note about this*

the cube has been inverted and has a texture to it. One axis is -15, wich gives a negative value
