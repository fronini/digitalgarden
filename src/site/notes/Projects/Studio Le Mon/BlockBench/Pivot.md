- Pivot Tool

**Pivot** = The model's origin.

The very position where the 3D world thinks the cube is located. Mastering the pivot position is the difference between a good and a master modeler

You can also move the pivot with the Vertex snap tool, as shown here:

Just be aware, that the pivot and the vertice are in the same location, making it difficult for Blockbench to tell wich one to select for you when you click on them. One way to solve this issue, is to just go to the pivot tool and move it away from the corner, as shown here:
